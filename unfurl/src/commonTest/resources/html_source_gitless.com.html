		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Gitless is a Git-compatible version control system, that is
			easy to learn and use:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Simple commit workflow</strong><br/>
				Track or untrack files to control
				what changes to commit. Changes to tracked files are
				committed by default, but you can easily customize the set of files to
				commit using flags
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Independent branches</strong><br/>
				Branches in Gitless include your working changes, so you
				can switch between branches without having to worry about conflicting
				uncommitted changes
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Friendly command-line interface</strong><br/>
				Gitless commands will give you good feedback and help you figure out
				what to do next
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Compatible with Git</strong><br/>
				Because Gitless is implemented on top of Git, you can always fall back
				on Git. And your coworkers you share a repo with need never
				know that you're not a Git aficionado. Moreover, you can use Gitless
				with GitHub or with any Git hosting service
			</li>

		<a id="repository"><h3>Creating a Repository</h3></a>
		<p>
			Say you are in directory <code>foo</code> and you want turn it into a
			repository. You do this with the
			<code><a id="gl-init">gl init</a></code> command. This transforms
			the current working directory into an empty repository and you
			are now ready to start saving changes to files in <code>foo</code>:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> mkdir foo
<span class="shell">$</span> cd foo/
<span class="shell">$</span> gl init
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/foo</span></code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			In most cases, instead of starting with an empty repository, there's already
			some existing remote repository you want to work on. To clone a remote repository,
			you pass the URL of the repository to the same <code>gl init</code> command, as
			shown below (note that you'll have
			to replace <code>https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless</code> with
			the URL of your repo):
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> mkdir try-gitless
<span class="shell">$</span> cd try-gitless/
<span class="shell">$</span> gl init https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/try-gitless</span>
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Initialized from remote https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless</span></code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			If you don't have a remote repository yet, you can follow
			<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">these instructions</a> to create one on
			GitHub.
		</p>

		<a id="changes"><h3>Saving Changes</h3></a>
		<p>
			Now that you have your local repository, it's time to start saving
			changes to files. A file in Gitless can be <em>tracked</em>,
			<em>untracked</em> or <em>ignored</em>.
			A <em>tracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless will detect.
			Tracked files are automatically considered for commit if they are
			modified and appear listed under the "Tracked files with modifications"
			section of <code>status</code>.
			Conversely, an <em>untracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless
			will not detect. These are not automatically considered for commit and
			appear listed under the "Untracked files" section of
			<code>status</code>.
			Finally, an <em>ignored file</em> is a file that is completely ignored by
			Gitless and it won't even appear in the output of <code>status</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example output of the <code><a id="gl-status">gl status</a></code>
			command
			(<code>foo.py</code> and <code>bar.py</code> are tracked files
			with modifications, <code>.gitignore</code> is an unmodified tracked file,
			<code>baz.py</code> is an untracked file and <code>foo.pyc</code> is an
			ignored file):
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> ls
bar.py  baz.py  foo.py  foo.pyc .gitignore
<span class="shell">$</span> gl status
On branch <span class="ansi-green">master</span>, repo-directory <span class="ansi-green">//</span>

Tracked files with modifications:
  ➜ these will be automatically considered for commit
  ➜ use gl untrack &lt;f&gt; if you don't want to track changes to file f
  ➜ if file f was committed before, use gl checkout &lt;f&gt; to discard local changes

    <span class="ansi-yellow">foo.py</span>
    <span class="ansi-yellow">bar.py</span>

Untracked files:
  ➜ these won't be considered for commit)
  ➜ use gl track &lt;f&gt; if you want to track changes to file f

    <span class="ansi-blue">baz.py</span></code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now, how do files move between these three different <em>disjoint</em>
			states?
		</p>
		<p>
			A file is ignored if it's matched by the ignore specification described in
			a <code>.gitignore</code> file.
			In the example above,
			there is a <code>.gitignore</code> file whose content is '*.pyc'; since
			<code>foo.pyc</code> is matched by that pattern it's therefore an
			ignored file.
		</p>
		<p>
			A new file that is not matched by the ignore spec is initially an untracked
			file. If you want to track it you can do so with the
			<code><a id="gl-track">gl track</a></code> command. You can stop tracking
			changes to a tracked file
			with the <code><a id="gl-untrack">gl untrack</a></code> command.
			You can always revert a file back to some previous version with the
			<code><a id="gl-checkout">gl checkout</a></code> command.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl track baz.py
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File baz.py is now a tracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl track baz.py
<span class="ansi-red">✘ File baz.py is already a tracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl untrack baz.py
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File baz.py is now an untracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl checkout foo.py
You have uncommitted changes in foo.py that would be
overwritten by checkout. Do you wish to continue? (y/N)
&gt; y
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File foo.py checked out successfully to its state at HEAD</span></code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			To save changes to files you use
			<code><a id="gl-commit">gl commit</a></code>.
			By default, all tracked modified files are considered
			for commit, but the set of files to commit can be customized by listing
			the files to be committed only, or using the <code>e/exclude</code> and <code>i/include</code>
			flags:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "foo and bar"
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo" foo.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo and baz" foo.py baz.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo" -e bar.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo and baz" -e bar.py -i baz.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "foo, bar and baz" -i baz.py</code></pre></div>
		<p>
			There's also a <code>p/partial</code> flag that allows you to
			interactively select segments of files to commit.
		<p>
		<p>
			The <code><a id="gl-diff">gl diff</a></code> command can be used to see the
			difference between the working and committed versions of files. Like
			<code>commit</code>, the default set of files to diff is
			the set of all tracked modified files but it can be customized by
			listing files, or using the <code>e/exclude</code> and <code>i/include</code>
			flags.
		</p>
		<p>
			To remove files simply do it like you would in
			your operating system (e.g., using Unix's <code>rm</code> command). Gitless
			will detect the change if the file was tracked, and it will appear as removed
			in <code>status</code>. Gitless currently doesn't detect renames. If you rename a file,
			Gitless will interpret this as a file with the old name being removed and a new one
			(with the new name and content) being created. If you want the renamed file to be tracked
			again you need to track it with <code>gl track</code>.
		</p>


		<a id="branching"><h3>Branching</h3></a>
		<p>
			A branch is an independent line of development. You are always working
			on some branch. Each branch has its own history (which you can look at
			with the <a id="gl-history">gl history</a> command). Any changes to
			existing files or new files you create on a branch will not be present on
			the other branch when you switch branches.
		</p>
		<p>To create a new branch you use the
			<a id="gl-branch">gl branch</a>
			command. To switch to another branch you use the
			<a id="gl-switch">gl switch</a> command:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl branch -c develop
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Created new branch develop</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl switch develop
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Switched to branch develop</span>
</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			To list all branches:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl branch
List of branches:
  ➜ do gl branch &lt;b&gt; to create branch b
  ➜ do gl branch -d &lt;b&gt; to delete branch b
  ➜ do gl switch &lt;b&gt; to switch to branch b
  ➜ * = current branch

    <span class="ansi-green">* master</span>
      <span class="ansi-yellow">develop</span>
</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>
			Each branch has a head, which is the last commit done on the branch.
			By default, the head of a new branch is going to be equal to the
			head of the current branch. If you want a different commit to be the
			head of the new branch you can provide one with the
			<code>dp/divergent-point</code> flag.
		</p>
		<p>
			To specify a commit you can use its id, or you can specify it via an ancestry
			reference with <code>~</code>: <code>HEAD~n</code> refers to
			the nth commit before head.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the head of the current branch you use the <code>sh/set-head</code> flag.
			The <code>sh</code> flag is useful to, for example, amend the last commit:
			to do so, run <code>gl branch -sh HEAD~1</code>.
			Changing the head of the current branch won't touch your working directory, if you
			additionally want to reset your working directory to match the new head
			you use <code>gl checkout</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually branches will end up having divergent
			changes. There are two ways to bring changes from one branch onto the
			current branch: <em>merge</em> and <em>fuse</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Merging branches.</em>
			For merging the changes in <code>develop</code> onto the current branch
			you do <code><a id="gl-merge">gl merge develop</a></code>. This creates
			a new merge commit that includes the changes in <code>develop</code> in
			addition to those changes in the current branch:
		</p>
		<div class="fig">
			<img src="merge.png" alt="merge">
		</div>


		<p>
			<em>Fusing branches.</em> Fusing branches gives you more control than
			merging. When you fuse changes from some branch onto the
			current branch you can specify the commits to fuse and the insertion
			point. By default, all divergent commits are fused and the insertion
			point is the divergent point (the point where the source branch diverged
			from the current).
			For example, the following figure depicts a situation in which there are
			two branches: <code>master</code> (the current branch) and
			<code>develop</code>. The last commit these two branches have in common is
			<code>A</code>. This commit is the "divergent point" (because
			it is the point at which <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code>
			diverged).
			After doing <code><a id="gl-fuse">gl fuse develop</a></code>, the commits
			in <code>develop</code> are inserted in <code>master</code> after the
			divergent point:
		</p>
		<div class="fig">
			<img src="fuse.png" alt="fuse" class="fig">
		</div>
		<p>
			To choose other insertion points you use the
			<code>ip/insertion-point</code> flag. You can give a commit id as input,
			<code>head</code> or <code>dp/divergent-point</code>:
		</p>
		<div class="fig">
			<img src="fuse_ip.png" alt="fuse with insertion point specified">
		</div>
		<p>
			The <code>o/only</code> and <code>e/exclude</code> flags can be used to
			customize the set of commits to be fused:
		</p>
		<div class="fig">
			<img src="fuse_ip_o.png"
					 alt="fuse with insertion point and commit specified">
		</div>
		<p>
			During this process conflicts could occur. If so, the <code>gl status</code> command will change
			accordingly to indicate the files in conflict. Once you edit those files in
			conflict you mark them as resolved with
			<code><a id="gl-resolve">gl resolve</a></code> (passing the files to mark as input). Once all
			conflicts have been resolved
			you do <code>gl commit</code> to commit to continue with the fuse or
			merge.
		</p>
		<p>
			A branch can have an "upstream branch." If a branch has an upstream
			associated with it, then <code>gl fuse</code> or <code>gl merge</code> can
			be used as shorthands for <code>gl {fuse, merge} upstream_branch</code>.
			To set an upstream branch for the current branch use
			<code>gl branch -su upstream_branch</code>.
		</p>


		<a id="tagging"><h3>Tagging</h3></a>
		<p>
			You use tags to signify a commit is special in some way. For example, you
			can use <code><a id="gl-tag">gl tag</a></code> to create a tag with name
			"v1.0" and make it point to the commit that represents release v1.0:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl tag -c v1.0
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Created new tag v1.0</span>
</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>In this case, the tag will point to the head of the current branch, but
			you can tag other commits with the <code>ci/commit</code> flag.
		</p>
		<p>
			To list all tags:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl tag
List of tags:
  ➜ do gl tag &lt;t&gt; to create tag t
  ➜ do gl tag -d &lt;t&gt; to delete tag t

    v1.0 ➜  tags <span class="ansi-yellow">311bf7c</span> Ready to release
</code></pre>
		</div>


		<a id="remote"><h3>Working with Remote Repositories</h3></a>
		<p>
			To refer to a remote repository you could always use its URL, but an
			easier alternative is to add the repository as a "remote" with the
			<code><a id="gl-remote">gl remote</a></code> command:
		</p>
		<div class="code"><pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl remote -c try-gitless https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Remote try-gitless mapping to https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless created
successfully</span>
  ➜ to list existing remotes do gl remote
  ➜ to remove try-gitless do gl remote -d try-gitless
</code></pre></div>
		<p>
			Now you can use <code>try-gitless</code> to refer to this remote repository
			and use <code>try-gitless/some-branch</code> to refer to the branch of name
			<code>some-branch</code> that lives in <code>try-gitless</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Downloading Changes.</em>
			It is also possible to fuse or merge changes from remote
			branches. For example, doing <code>gl merge try-gitless/master</code>
			would merge changes in that remote branch that are not present in your
			local current branch. You can also use <code>gl fuse</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Uploading Changes.</em>
			To send changes upstream you use
			<code><a id="gl-publish">gl publish</a></code>. The publish command will
			default to updating the upstream branch of the current branch if none is
			given as input.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Creating, Deleting, or Listing Remote Branches.</em>
			To create, delete, or list remote branches you use the same <code>gl branch</code>
			command that you use for local branches. If you do
			<code>gl branch -c try-gitless/develop</code> this will create a branch
			<code>develop</code> that lives in the remote <code>try-gitless</code>.
			Recall that, by default, the head of this new branch will be equal to the head of
			the current branch, so all commits that are not present in the remote
			will be uploaded. To list remote branches use the
			<code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl branch</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Creating, Deleting, or Listing Remote Tags.</em>
			To create or delete remote tags you use the <code>gl tag</code> command.
			If you do
			<code>gl tag -c try-gitless/v1.0</code> this will create a new tag
			<code>v1.0</code> that lives in the remote <code>try-gitless</code>. You can also list
			remote tags with the <code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl tag</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you create a local repository from a remote (by passing a URL as
			input to the <code>gl init</code> command), a local branch is created
			for each remote branch, and each local branch is automatically configured
			to have as upstream its remote counterpart.

		<h2>Branching</h2>
		<p>
			The main thing to understand is that in Gitless a branch is a completely
			independent line of development. Each branch keeps its working version
			of files separate from each other. Whenever you switch to a different
			branch, the contents of your working directory are saved, and the ones
			corresponding to the branch you are switching to are retrieved. The
			classifications of files are also saved (i.e., a file can
			be untracked on some branch but tracked on another and Gitless will
			remember this):
